                <p>The world of Gaming Finance (GameFi) has continued to evolve ever since the rise of decentralized
                    finance in the gaming scene. GameFI offers video game players an outstanding opportunity to make
                    real-life money from their video gaming exploits.</p>
                <p>However, despite the industry’s ever-growing popularity, GameFi lacks several essential resources to
                    make it more beneficial to users. A case in point is the absence of an information aggregation tool
                    for everything happening within the industry. This is where a platform like ChainPlay comes in
                    handy.</p>

                    ChainPlay is and how to use it wisely.</p>
                <h2>What Is ChainPlay?</h2>
                <p><img src="assets/images/blog-detail-image--2.png" alt=""></p>

                    information from many areas of the GameFi market. Instead of researching each crypto gaming project
                    individually to know its potential, investment opportunities, and events, ChainPlay consolidates and
                    gives users all this information in one platform. This aggregated, real-time information saves you
                    time and ensures you remain ever knowledgeable of the happenings within the play-to earn gaming
                    space.</p>
                <h2>Which Are the Best ChainPlay Features For Analyzing Blockchain Games?</h2>
                <p><img src="assets/images/blog-detail-image--3.png" alt="" class="aligncenter"></p>
                <p>The crypto gaming scene comes with overwhelming information. There’s always new information on crypto
                    game rankings and fundraising events. Different gaming projects also multiple investment
                    opportunities, guilds, and events to take part in. ChainPlay’s primary focus is to debunk this
                    information and consolidate it on one user-friendly platform.</p>
                <p>To do this, the information aggregator portal has many features. Below are some of ChainPlay’s most
                    essential features and what you can use them for.</p>
                <h3>Market Cap Rank Feature</h3>
                <p>One of the most important details you need on Blockchain games is their performance. Knowing how well
                    a game is doing can help a player or investor decide whether it is worth their while.</p>
                <p>ChainPlay makes it possible for users to see the performance of a blockchain gaming project using the
                    market cap rank feature. With this feature, users can see transaction volumes and token prices in
                    real-time. Market cap rank also comes with a seamless interface design that ensures users get the
                    best experience.</p>
                <h3>Large Market Movers Feature</h3>
                <p>If all you’re looking for is information on which blockchain projects gained or lost the most value
                    during a specific time, you can use the large market movers feature to filter out results.</p>
                <p>The feature lists crypto games based on the value their tokens gained or lost. It also has filters
                    that help you observe these values per blockchain, genre, or platform. You can also adjust the
                    feature to show you results for the last 24 hours, a week, or even 30 days.</p>
                <h3>Fundraising Feature</h3>
                <p>Knowing how much money a particular gaming project raised and the project’s Return on Investment(ROI)
                    is also significant when selecting a crypto gaming project to be part of. You should avoid older
                    projects with low ROI or few investors because they don’t offer much in terms of profits.</p>
                <p>Using the fundraising feature on Chain Play, you can quickly identify fundraising dates, the total
                    amount of funding a project received, and the investors involved. This feature is also handy for
                    investors because it helps them spot current market trends in cash flow for venture capital funds.
                    They can also use it to assess how much capital has been recently pooled into the crypto gaming
                    markets and the average fundraising size of each gaming project.</p>
                <h3>Investor Feature</h3>
                <p>ChainPlay also assists you to keep tabs on crypto gaming investors. The platform has an investors’
                    feature that shows the latest information on investors. Among the details you can find are the
                    number of gaming projects the investor has, the ROI of these projects, and which investments have
                    made them the highest ROI.</p>
                <h3>Gaming IGO Feature</h3>
                <p>Besides giving real-time information on crypto games, ChainPlay offers users a deep dive into the
                    past performance of crypto gaming projects listed on the platform. You can obtain summaries on ICOs,
                    IDOs, IEOs, and IGOs in crypto gaming using “Gaming IGO” This feature is what you need to find out
                    all the crucial details about public funding for a particular blockchain game.</p>
                <h3>Launchpads Feature</h3>
                <p>For investors who don’t have much money to put into GameFi, ChainPlay’s launchpad feature offers
                    unique investment insights. With aggregated information on all gaming launchpads, you can identify a
                    launchpad’s minimum entry cost, its ATH ROI, and ROI with extreme ease.</p>
                <h3>Gaming Guild Performance Feature</h3>
                <p>Finding a gaming guild that suits one’s needs is getting more complicated over time because of the
                    vast amount of information on crypto gaming. But, ChainPlay has a gaming guild feature that
                    simplifies the research process for you. This feature lists all the critical information you need to
                    settle on a given guild. With this feature, you will find details about the number of communities a
                    guild owns on discord, how many gaming projects it has participated in, and its market cap as well.
                    There are also other key investment details like the guild’s take rate that is indicated to the
                    profit splitting ratio to its scholars.</p>
                <h3>Events</h3>
                <p>Many crypto gaming enthusiasts miss out on opportunities because they can’t keep up with all the
                    dates. Chainplay solves the problem by providing its users with an events calendar for all
                    blockchain gaming events.</p>
